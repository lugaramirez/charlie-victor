{Software Engineer}
{Feb '17 -- present}
{\bodytext{\textbf{Key Contributions:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Re-definition of the stack for internal apps.} Due to the changing environment and requests by the main dev team of the client company, microservices and REST services were fased out and a more traditional monolith approach is currently being used, in conjuction with template engines.
  \item \textbf{Updating of an old app to observe tax regulation changes.} By inserting Spring-capable services to the old app in order to use the new services available that observe the change in regulations. The strong time constrain of this update was achieved nonetheless.
  \item \textbf{Definition of the stack to be used during code development.} By using Spring Framework and Netflix OSS, complete REST services are developed by the team.
  \item \textbf{Definition of the ops stack to be used to manage servers and services.} Currently using Apache Tomcat and Spring Boot web app files. The use of Docker and Kubernetes is under test to help in the CD process.
  \item \textbf{Definition of the CD pipeline.} The pipeline now uses only a code repository and with Jenkins, it pushes a new build to the test server, after some basic testing and static code analysis provided by Sonarqube.

{May '16 -- Jan '17}
{\bodytext{\textbf{Key Contributions:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Establishing the use of gitflow as the process of code repository management.} Since there was no system before, it was a hard challenge to teach every devolper the full powers of git.
  \item \textbf{Establishing the new modules/layering system of the code.} It was done so it would help writing the before inexistent unit- and integration-tests. End-to-end tests were left to the future, although some smoke tests were written.
